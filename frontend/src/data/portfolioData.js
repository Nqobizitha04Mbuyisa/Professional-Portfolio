export const summary = `Junior Software Engineer specializing in Java backend development, with a strong foundation in computer science and Information Technology. Hands-on experience building database-driven applications and designing RESTful systems using Java, SQL, and modern development tools. Passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and building scalable solutions to real-world problems.`;

export const aboutLong = [
  "I am a Junior Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & IT from the University of KwaZulu-Natal. My focus is backend development the parts of an application most users never see, but absolutely depend on every second.",
  "I love turning fuzzy real-world problems into structured systems: a clear database schema, a clean REST contract, predictable error handling, and code that the next developer (often future me) can read without flinching.",
  "Outside of building, I obsess over fundamentals data structures, algorithms, OOP, and system design \u2014 because shortcuts there cost you later. I'm currently looking for a junior backend role where I can ship real software and grow fast.",
